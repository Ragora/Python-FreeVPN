# Python-FreeVPN

FreeVPN is an experimental VPN framework that is built to support any number of backend protocols by using a standardized
protocol interface all written in Python. Currently, the only supported protocol is SSH using reverse port forwarding to create
tunnels between your computer and the server for encrypted communications and routing.
